The sales file has information about sold vehicles. This is a mix of customer personal information like name and
address as well as the vehicle sold and the price it was sold at. Some fields are empty like discount, trade-in, and returning customer. 
One sale did not have the purchase price. The customer relations file also has customer personal information like name, address, ocupation, and sale status. 
Overall, the data appears to be of good quality. There a only a few missing fields and can be broken down into separate tables.
