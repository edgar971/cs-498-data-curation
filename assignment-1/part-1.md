The inventory file contains vehicle information like make, year, model, and price. 
It also includes an ID unique to each vehicle and mostly information used to list the car for sale. 
The sales file has information about sold vehicles. This is a mix of customer personal information like name and
address as well as the vehicle sold and the price it was sold at. Some fields are empty like discount, trade-in, and returning customer. 
One sale did not have the purchase price. The customer relations file also has customer personal information like name, address, occupation, and sale status. 
Overall, the data appears to be of good quality. There are only a few missing fields (specially in the sales file) and can be broken down into separate tables.
